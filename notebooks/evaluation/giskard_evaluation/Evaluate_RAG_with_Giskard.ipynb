Many students take classes once and then join a later cohort to benefit from the updates.The lifetime access removes any pressure from having to complete the program when life gets in the way.Hey! I'm Santiago.I'm the instructor of the program.I'm a machine learning engineer with over two decades of experience building and scaling enterprise software and machine learning systems.I love neural networks. I love to make them work at scale.From 2009 to 2023, I built products for Disney, Boston Dynamics, IBM, Dell, G4S, Anheuser-Busch, and NextEra Energy, among other clients. I learned about trade-offs and how to create products that work.I started this program in\n",
