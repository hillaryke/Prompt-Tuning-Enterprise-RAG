       "'Few-shot learning is a machine learning approach where a model is prompted with a small number of demonstrations, each containing manually written or model-generated high-quality reasoning chains. These demonstrations provide the model with examples of both input and desired output on the target task. By exposing the model to these few high-quality examples, it can better understand human intention and criteria for the desired answers. This approach often leads to better performance compared to zero-shot learning, where the model is simply fed the task text and asked for results without any prior examples. However, few-shot learning comes with the cost of consuming more tokens and may face limitations in context length when dealing with long input and output text.\\n\\nIn the context of language models, such as GPT-3, biases like majority label bias, recency bias, and common token bias can affect the performance of few-shot learning. Researchers have proposed methods to calibrate the label probabilities output by the model to address these biases and improve performance. Additionally, studies have shown that the choice of prompt format, training examples, and the order of examples can significantly impact the performance of few-shot learning, ranging from near random guess to near state-of-the-art results.\\n\\nOverall, few-shot learning is a valuable approach in machine learning that leverages a small number of high-quality examples to enable models to generalize and perform well on new tasks with limited training data.'"
